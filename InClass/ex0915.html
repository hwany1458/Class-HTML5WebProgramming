        <p>The Metaverse is a collection of every virtual world built using blockchain technology. They can be gaming planets or NFT galleries, curated lands, or digital streets. </p>

        <p>
The main thing to always remember when you think about the Metaverse is that it is not one place. It is the aggregate of the new digital spaces that people are calling the next iteration of the internet. </p>

        <p>Media companies, music publishers, sportswear brands and cryptocurrency analytics platforms all have a presence in the Metaverse. So too do rock stars, rappers, Care Bears and Smurfs. So it’s a broad church and there’s room for everyone.
